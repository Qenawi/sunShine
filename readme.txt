basic weather app we developed it on android nano degre (udacity)
make use of loadrs and  map Api to show curent location
user can change his/her location  throw settings->location->(cityname/code)
basic notificatification sys 
make use of shared prefs to retreve location
parts of code are copied  but Its concept  was understood very well and further tests/tasks will prove my words

2)on click in any of next dayes detail activity show in detail chossen day weather +wind speed
3)on detail screen  share vai msg is avilble
